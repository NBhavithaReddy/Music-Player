# Music-Player
## Description:
This project covers the basic functionalities of a generic music player. It allows a user to play, pause and skip songs while also allowing them to add new songs to the queue.

## Contents:
This repository contains two folders, music and covers, besides the html, css and js files. The two folders contain the songs and cover images for the songs respectively.
**To be compatible with the code, the names of the songs and their corresponding cover images should be the same.**

## Instructions to run:
 * Make sure there is at least one file each in the music and cover folders.
 * Update the src values of audio and img according to the template of the code in the html and js files.
 * Open the index.html file is your browser.

## End note:
This is the first version of the application and covers the most fundamental operations of a music player. Improvements can be made by adding a drag-drop functionality to sort the songs in the queue and by reading files directly from the folder.
